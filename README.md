# ksp-simpit

This is the code to drive my dream of a modular control panel/simpit in kerbal space program.

This respoitory is for the arduino side of the code. Most of the credit goes to zitroenen for KSPserialIO, and I've largely just modified his demo to get my board working.

Also included is LCSeven, which is my modifered version of wayoda's LedControl. Probably doing really easy things in inefficient and unecessarily complicated thing since I haven't bothered trying to optimize it yet.
